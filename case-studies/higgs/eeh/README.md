## Electron Yukawa coupling via s-channel e+e− → H production at the Higgs pole

### Abstract

Measuring the electron Yukawa is impossible in Higgs boson decays, H → e+e−, given the smallness of the electron mass that leads to a negligible decay branching ratio. The only direct method to extract it is through resonant s-channel production in e+e− collisions running at (exactly) the Higgs pole mass. Such a measurement requires monochromatization of the beams leading to a centre-of-mass energy spread not much larger than the Higgs boson width δ√s ≈ Γ<sub>H</sub> = 4.2 MeV, as well as an accurate and precise knowledge of the Higgs boson mass, within MeV uncertainties. A preliminary study, combining 10 different Higgs decay modes, indicates that a 0.7σ significance above the (much larger) backgrounds can be reached for every 10 ab<sup>−1</sup> integrated at the FCC-ee [1]. An update of the analysis, using the latest developments in machine-learning tools, will be carried out in order to further suppress backgrounds, and determine the precision on the electron Yukawa coupling ultimately reachable.
